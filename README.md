**Current Version**: 0.1

Please see the ioslides_template.html and the lab_template.html to get an idea of what the template outputs looks like.


Access the [User Best Practice Guide](http://bit.ly/stats_templates_guide) for tips & guidelines for using the templates.



*These templates are still under development. Any comments, feedback, additions, or suggestions are welcome.* 

### Getting started:
- Download the files from the GitHub link as a zip file. 
    - GitHub users are welcome to clone or fork. 
- You can now use the ioslides_template.rmd as you would like any other rmd file.
- Note: you must have the figure files in the figures folder for the template to run correctly. See "A few pointers" below for details.
    - If you use R Studio, there is an R Studio project file included if you wish to use that. You will need to set that up the usual way you set up R Studio projects (which is not covered here). 
- We strongly recommend that you read the [User Best Practice Guide](http://bit.ly/stats_templates_guide) for tips & guidelines for using the templates.
