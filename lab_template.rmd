# Example section with 3 tabs {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

## Overview
Here is some text, followed by a video below. 
Change the YouTube link in the .rmd file to get a different video.

<div style="max-width:640"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a6KGPBflhiM" width="560" height="315" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

## Statistical Thinking

<br>

## Wrangle the data (Ext)
A generic data code block here as an example:

R Studio has many data sets already loaded in. Read about the [mtcars data set](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html).

- View the data.
```{r,eval=F}
mtcars
```

Clearly this is not recommended for large data sets!

<br>

- Instead, we can look at the first or last rows using the `head` or `tail` functions.
```{r,eval=F}
head(mtcars)
tail(mtcars, n=3)
```

<br>

- Calculate the `dim`ensions of the data set.
```{r,eval=F}
dim(mtcars)
```
This means that there are 32 rows (the types of cars) and 11 variables (properties of the cars).

<br>

- List the `names` of the variables.
```{r,eval=F}
names(mtcars)
```

<br>

- See how R has classified the variables by viewing the `str`ucture of the data.
```{r,eval=F}
str(mtcars)
```

where 'num' is a quantitative (numerical) variable and 'Factor' is a qualitative (categorical) variable.

<br>

# Example section with no tabs

In this section we have a Code Block and some LaTeX commands.

Try the following commands in R.
```{r,eval=F}
1+ exp(3) + sin(0.5)
x=c(1,2,3)
x^2
sum(x)
```

How could you work out $\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_{i}^3$?

<br>

Here is some in-line code `normal size in-line code`
<br>
Here is some in-line code that we have reduced in size <span class="code">`small in-line code`</span>

# Example section with images

Here is am image. It has not been adjusted in the rmd file, so represents the true size of the original image.

<br>
Here is the same image with some adjustments in the rmd file to reduce the output by 50% and make it left aligned:
<div align="left">
<img src="figures/kittens.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
</div>
<br>
See the .rmd file for the differences in the markdown.

# Example section with a simple table

Here is a simple table.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
|---------------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

# Section - Summary (with tabs) {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Main block of text here.

## Exploration
Using the data in `XYZ_dataset.xlxs`, construct graphical summaries to analyse trends in ABC.

<br>

## Summary
Summarise your findings in a paragraph.

<br>

# Project X
This lab relates to Project X.
